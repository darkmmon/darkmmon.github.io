# Ivan Yiu — AI Developer Portfolio (Introduction)

Introduction
Hello, I’m Ivan Yiu, an aspiring AI developer passionate about turning ideas into intelligent, real-world solutions. I’m currently focused on building strong foundations in machine learning, software engineering, and data-informed decision making.

## Key strengths

- Foundational ML and AI concepts: supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation, feature engineering, and model deployment.
- Programming and tooling: proficient in Python and Typescript, with experience creating real ai applications and products.
  - python libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - typescript libraries: react, nodejs, ai sdk,
- Software craftsmanship: version control (Git), test-driven development, clean architecture, and scalable software design.
- Data mindset: data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and domain-oriented problem framing to drive meaningful insights.
- Collaboration and communication: translating complex technical ideas into clear, actionable plans for stakeholders and teammates.

## What I bring to a team

- A curious and rapid learner who thrives on solving challenging problems with rigor and creativity.
- A user-centered approach, always considering ethics, fairness, and interpretability in AI solutions.
- A collaborative mindset, eager to work across disciplines (product, design, data engineering) to deliver end-to-end impact.
- A bias toward action: quick prototyping, iterative improvement, and measurable outcomes.

## Areas I’m exploring next

- Scalable model deployment and monitoring (MLOps), including CI/CD for ML pipelines.
- Advanced opportunities in natural language processing, computer vision, or reinforcement learning.
- Responsible AI, model interpretability, and robust evaluation under real-world constraints.
