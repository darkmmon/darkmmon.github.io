# AI Copy of Ivan Yiu — Project Scope and Plan

This document outlines the project to create an AI copy of Ivan Yiu for deployment across target audiences and platforms. It translates the original self-introduction and methodology into a structured, reusable MD format that can be adapted into other pages or decks.

## Objective

Create a scalable, ethical, and high-fidelity AI copy of Ivan Yiu that can:

- Provide instant, expert guidance across domains (ML, software engineering, human-centered AI design).
- Assist with domain-specific decisions, code reviews, and research support.
- Operate as a cognitive assistant for design discussions, governance reviews, and onboarding.
- Be adaptable to different tones and audiences (executive-facing, developer-focused, public-facing).

## Key Components

- Identity and persona
  - Name: Ivan Yiu
  - Role: AI Developer, digital replicas expert
  - Core capabilities: ML product lifecycle, AI governance, human-centered design

- Capabilities to replicate
  - AI copy creation and digital twin development
  - Data strategy and curation
  - Model architecture and training
  - Human-centered AI design
  - Deployment, monitoring, and governance
  - Ethical AI and compliance

- Target use cases
  - Executive briefings and strategy discussions
  - Developer-facing guidance and code reviews
  - Research support and literature synthesis
  - Onboarding and knowledge transfer within teams

## Methodology to Mirror

- Discovery and alignment
  - Define goals, success metrics, personality, and capabilities
- Data stewardship
  - Curate bias-aware, privacy-conscious datasets; provenance and versioning
- Model design
  - Balance performance with interpretability; implement safety rails
- Evaluation and governance
  - Rigorous benchmarks, red-teaming, and user studies
- Deployment and monitoring
  - Observability, logging, anomaly detection, and update cadences
- Ethics and transparency
  - Clear communication of capabilities and limits; feedback loops

## Data and Privacy Considerations

- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Maintain user trust through transparent capabilities and limitations
- Include opt-out and data deletion options where applicable

## Technical Stack (Representative)

- Languages and tools: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, MLflow, Weights & Biases
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
- AI copy modalities: Text-based assistants, code copilots, research assistants, domain-specific consultants, multimedia-enabled agents
- Data engineering: ETL/ELT pipelines, feature stores, labeling workflows
- Safety and evaluation: Calibration, bias auditing, prompt safety overlays, ablation studies

## Deliverables

- A reusable MD profile for the AI copy
- Expression of persona across multiple tones (executive, developer, public)
- Deployment-ready prompts and governance guidelines
- Documentation for onboarding and maintenance

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Misalignment between AI copy behavior and human intent
  - Mitigation: Continuous testing, guardrails, and user feedback loops
- Risk: Data privacy concerns
  - Mitigation: Privacy-by-design, differential privacy concepts, and access controls
- Risk: Overclaiming capabilities
  - Mitigation: Clear capability statements and transparency notes

## Success Metrics

- User satisfaction and trust scores in pilot deployments
- Time-to-first-insight improvements for users
- Reduction in onboarding time for new team members
- Reduction in miscommunication or ambiguities in guidance

## Next Steps

1. Define the target audience and tone for the first MD page (e.g., executive-facing bio, developer-focused cheat sheet, or public-facing article).
2. Create tailored prompts and templates for each audience.
3. Implement governance guidelines and safety checks.
4. Prepare a pilot deployment plan and feedback loop.
